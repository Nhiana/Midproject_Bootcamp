Accident Crash Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize various factors related to car crashes, such as road conditions, collision types, weather conditions, light conditions, and more. Through data analysis and visualization, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and insights to improve road safety and awareness.

Data Source
. Public Dataset from IRONHACK

Key Insights:

1) Top 5 Road Conditions with Most Accidents
![Top 5 road_condition](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\road_condition line plot.JPG)

Insights derived from the visualization.
.Overall, addressing these frequent conditions can significantly enhance road safety.

2) Top 5 Most Frequent Collision Types

Insights derived from the visualization:
. These insights highlight common collision patterns, emphasizing rear-end and single-vehicle incidents.

3) Top 5 Most Frequent Weather Conditions

Insights derived from the visualization:
.Overall, understanding these weather-related trends can help in developing targeted safety measures and awareness campaigns to reduce accidents during these conditions.


4) Top 5 Most Frequent Light Conditions

Insights derived from the visualization:
.the data underscores the importance of visibility and lighting conditions in road safety, emphasizing areas where improvements or awareness campaigns might be beneficial.

5) Most Frequent Road Condition and Road Grade
![Top 5 light conditions & road_grade](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\heatmap of road_type & road_condition final.JPG)

Insights derived from the visualization:
. while the majority of accidents occur on level roads without defects, various road conditions and grades, especially slopes and specific road features, contribute to reported incidents. Understanding these patterns can guide efforts to enhance road safety measures and infrastructure improvements.

6) Changes in Crashes Over Day Time
![Crashes Over Day Time](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\No. Of crashe s over daytime.JPG)

Insights derived from the visualization:
.Here, we can see mostly the crashes over day time is between 15:00 to 20:00 

7) Day of the Week with More Crashes
![Week with More Crashes](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\No. of crashes by day of the week-2.JPG)

Insights derived from the visualization:
.Here, we can see mostly the crashes are happening on friday's

8) Evolution of Crashes per Hour
![Crashes per Hour](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\Evolution of no. of crashes per hour.JPG)

Insights derived from the visualization:

9) Evolution of Crashes per Year
![Crashes per Year](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\Evolution of crashes per year.JPG)

Insights derived from the visualization:
.Here, the crashes are more in 2017 and least in 2020.

10) Agency Reporting More Crashes
![Agency Reporting More Crashes](C:\Users\priya\Documents\IRONHACK\Midproject_Bootcamp\Midproject_Bootcamp\Screensnaps\Agency has reported more crashes-2.JPG)

Insights derived from the data:
.Here, Montogemry reported the most crashes.

11) Two Sample t-test Analysis
